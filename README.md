## About the event

Welcome to the 2020 Hack for NF, a virtual Hackathon focused on building high-tech solutions to improve research, clinical innovation, and quality of life for patients living with neurofibromatosis (NF). NF is a rare genetic disease that causes benign and malignant tumors to grow throughout the body. More than 2.5 million people worldwide are affected and there is still no cure. CTFâ€™s mission is to drive research, expand knowledge and advance care for the NF community. Hack for NF is an initiative to bring together talent from various disciplines to help the NF community come closer to their vision to End NF. 
 
Hack for NF is offering three challenge tracks focused on NF Data, Mobile Device Engagement, and a Wildcard challenge. The NF Data track aims to: 1) re-use the data that NF researchers and scientists have already generated in innovative ways to answer interesting challenge questions, 2) incentivize data sharing as a powerful practice that will allow researchers to move at a faster pace and create new insights, and 3) create innovative collaborations between diverse disciplines.

## How to use this repository

We've prepared Docker containers that contain all of the necessary dependencies to retrieve available NF data from Synapse and perform some basic analyses of these data. The goal of this is to help you orient yourself to the data prior to the event in September.
We've created containers for both R and Python users. You can find instructions on running these containers and following the data demos below. 
If you like, you can also use these containers as a basis for creating your own Docker containers during the hackathon so that others can reproduce your analyses.

### Prerequisites 

These instructions assume that you:
* have registered for a [Synapse account](https://www.synapse.org/#!RegisterAccount:0) 
* have followed the [How to Participate and Getting the Data!](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22336443/wiki/605183) instructions on Synapse. 
* have [installed Docker Community Edition](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/) and that the docker service is running on your machine
* are running a Unix-based OS, such as Ubuntu or Mac. These instructions have not been tested on Windows-based platforms. If you are using Google Cloud Platform, please see the [Google Cloud Docker instructions](#google-cloud).

### RStudio Docker Image (Local)

1. Open a command line interface, such as Terminal. 
2. Do `docker pull nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-r` to get the Docker image. 
3. Do `docker run -e PASSWORD=<mypassword> -e ROOT=true --rm -p 8787:8787 nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-r` to start the container. Make sure to replace `<mypassword>` with a unique password. It cannot be "rstudio"!
4. Open your preferred browser and navigate to `localhost:8787`. Login using the username "rstudio" and the password that you set in step 3. 
5. In the Files pane, click on "0-setup.Rmd" to get started, and to learn how to make your Synapse credentials available to `synapser`. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE* To save any results created during your Docker session, you'll need to mount a local directory to the Docker container when you run it. This will copy anything saved to the working directory to your local machine. Before step 4, do `mkdir output` to create an output directory locally. Then run the command in step 4 with a `-v` flag e.g. `docker run -e PASSWORD=pwd --rm -p 8787:8787 -v $PWD/output:/home/rstudio/output nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-r` Alternatively, or in addition, you can save all of your results to Synapse using `synapser`.

### jupyter Docker Image (Local)

1. Open a command line interface, such as Terminal. 
2. Do `docker pull nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-py` to get the Docker image. 
3. Do `docker run -p 8888:8888 nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-py` to start the container.
4. Open your preferred browser and navigate to the one of the links provided in your Terminal window after running the previous command. It should look something like: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234`. 
5. In the Files pane, click on "Work" and then "0-setup.ipynb" to get started, and to learn how to make your Synapse credentials available to the Python `synapseclient`. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE* To save any results created during your Docker session, you'll need to mount a local directory to the Docker container when you run it. This will copy anything saved to the working directory to your local machine. Before step 4, do `mkdir output` to create an output directory locally. Then run the command in step 4 with a `-v` flag e.g. `docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD/output:/home/jovyan/work/output nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-py
` Alternatively, or in addition, you can save all of your results to Synapse using `synapseclient`.

### Google Cloud 

Please note, it's not necessary to run any of the docker containers we provide on the cloud, but we've provided instructions for doing this on Google Cloud if you prefer. This information will also be helpful if you want to use any other Rstudio or jupyter notebook-based Docker containers to conduct your analysis during the hackathon. 

1. Log into Google Cloud Platform and click on Compute Engine, followed by VM Instances. Click "Create". 
2. Name your instance, select a zone, and under "boot disk" click "change". 
3. Select a container optimized image: "Container-Optimized OS 73-xxxxx.xxx.x stable" 
4. Click "Allow HTTP Traffic", and then "Create"
5. After the instance has started, click on the instance's name in the VM Instances table, click Edit, and then add "docker-server" as a network tag. 
6. Navigate back to the VM Instances Table and click on the 3-dot menu after your instance, then click on "View Network Details". 
7. Click on Firewall Rules -> Create Rule. Type in a name (e.g. allow-tcp), add "docker-server" to the "Target Tags box, add 0.0.0.0/0 to the source IP range (or, if you know what IPs you'll be accessing the RStudio Server/jupyter sessions from, you can specify those IPs). Then, under Protocols and Ports, click Specified protocols and ports, check the "tcp:" box, and add 8787,8888 to the box. Click "Create" to make the rule. 
8. Return to the VM Instances Table and click "SSH" to open a new SSH window. Also, note the "External IP" for your instance, you'll need this later. 
9. Move to step 2 of the [GCP RStudio instructions](#rstudio-docker-image-gcp) or [GCP jupyter instructions](#jupyter-docker-image-gcp).

### RStudio Docker Image (GCP)

1. Open a command line interface, such as Terminal. 
2. Do `docker pull nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-r` to get the Docker image. 
3. Do `docker run -e PASSWORD=<mypassword> -e ROOT=true --rm -p 8787:8787 nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-r` to start the container. Make sure to replace `<mypassword>` with a unique password. It cannot be "rstudio"!
5. Open your preferred browser and use the External IP you noted in step 8 of the previous section to navigate to `external_ip:8787` - e.g. `12.345.678.910:8787`. Login using the username "rstudio" and the password that you set in step 4. 
6. In the Files pane, click on "0-setup.Rmd" to get started, and to learn how to make your Synapse credentials available to `synapser`. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE* To save any results created during your Docker session, you'll need to mount a local directory to the Docker container when you run it. This will copy anything saved to the working directory to your local machine. Before step 4, do `mkdir output` to create an output directory locally. Then run the command in step 4 with a `-v` flag e.g. `docker run -e PASSWORD=pwd --rm -p 8787:8787 -v $PWD/output:/home/rstudio/output nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-r` Alternatively, or in addition, you can save all of your results to Synapse using `synapser`.

### jupyter Docker Image (GCP)

1. Open a command line interface, such as Terminal. 
2. Do `docker pull nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-py` to get the Docker image. 
3. Do `docker run -p 8888:8888 nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-py` to start the container.
4. The GCP SSH window will provide a link after running the previous command. It should look something like: `http://(c89a7a7be700 or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234`. Replace the portion in parentheses with your instance External IP address that you noted in Step 8 of the [Google Cloud Docker instructions](#google-cloud) section. Navigate to this address, e.g. `http://12.345.678.910:8888/?token=abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234.`
5. In the Files pane, click on "Work" and then "0-setup.ipynb" to get started, and to learn how to make your Synapse credentials available to the Python `synapseclient`. 

*IMPORTANT NOTE* To save any results created during your Docker session, you'll need to mount a local directory to the Docker container when you run it. This will copy anything saved to the working directory to your local machine. Before step 4, do `mkdir output` to create an output directory locally.

### Running Docker containers on Windows

These instructions for running Docker on Windwows courtesy of [Lars Ericson](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18666641/discussion/threadId=5866):

We are given some [docker images provisioned with data and Python or R](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/nfhackathon2020) for quick setup for the challenge.

I haven't tried to dual-boot my Windows Home Edition PC to Linux.  I can still run the docker images.  Here is the path:

* Download [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/).  Note this is what works on Windows Home Edition.  You need Windows Professional to run the more recent Docker.  But it's OK, it still works.

* Run the newly installed Docker Quickstart 

* In Docker Quickstart, download one of the docker images listed on the GitHub, for example ```docker pull nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-py```

* In Docker Quickstart, run ```docker-machine ip``` to get the IP address.  Suppose it is 123.456.78.910.

* Run the docker image ``` docker run -p 8888:8888 nfosi/nf-hackathon-2020-py ``` It will tell you something like ```[I 00:16:50.410 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: [I 00:16:50.411 NotebookApp]  http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=fa13464756954b325753106b75c8398c991ce9d05ff523de```

* Replace IP address 127.0.0.1 with the string you wrote down in Step 3 (because Windows will probably be blocked 127.0.0.1 for Docker).  So something like ``` http://123.456.78.910:8888/?token=fa13464756954b325753106b75c8398c991ce9d05ff523de ```

* Paste the modified URL into your Browser to get to the Docker image Jupyter notebook.
